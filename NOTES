resolution algorithms
---------------------

 * CN is only based on direct collimation
     => leaving the collimators open will fail
 * ECK only considers the sample mosaic and geometry through secondary convolution
     => differences between POP and ECK
 * leaving direct collimation completely open can lead to different results between ALL algorithms



mingw
-----

* use tools: mingw64-cmake, mingw64-make
* needed libraries: /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/
* qt plugins: /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/qt4/plugins

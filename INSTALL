Preparations before compilation
-------------------------------


Install (developer versions of) all required libraries either from your
system's package manager or directly from the given URLs:
	* Boost: http://www.boost.org
	* Qt 4: http://www.qt.io
	* Qwt 6: http://qwt.sourceforge.net
	* Clipper: http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/clipper/
	* Tlibs: 
		- use ./setup_tlibs.sh
		- follow the instructions in the INSTALL file
		  in the ./tlibs/ subfolder

Set up other external dependencies:
	* ./setup_externals.sh


===============================================================================


Building Takin
--------------


Takin has to be compiled with a fully C++11 compliant compiler, e.g.:
	* GCC version 4.8 or above
	* Clang

Select appropriate Make lists (standard: (1) native, dynamic):
	* ./setup_makelists.sh

Make using CMake:
	* mkdir build
	* cd build
	* cmake ..
	* make
	* optional: make install (as root)


Run program with
	* takin
	* Or, in case tlibs is not found, 
	  e.g.: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib takin
